## 🌟 Overview

In the age of Industry 4.0, **predictive maintenance** is not just an advantage—it's a necessity. This project tackles one of the most critical challenges in industrial systems: **detecting gearbox faults before catastrophic failures occur**. By leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning architectures and innovative signal processing, we've created a robust, noise-resistant solution that transforms vibration data into actionable intelligence.
